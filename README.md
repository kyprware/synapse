# SYNAPSE

N.E.R.V.E is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide
context to LLMs and other applications. Think of NERVE like a ~~USB-C ports~~
HTTP/Web-sockets for models and applications. Just as ~~USB-C~~ HTTP/Web-sockets
provides an open-source standardized way to connect your devices to various
peripherals and accessories, N.E.R.V.E provides a standardized way to connect
models and applications to different data sources and tools.
