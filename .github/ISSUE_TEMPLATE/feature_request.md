## Feature Description

A clear and concise description of the feature or improvement you’re requesting.

[ Example: Allow Synapse to support WebSocket as a transport layer alongside TCP. ]

## Use Case

Explain how you or other users would benefit from this feature.

[ Example: Applications that operate in browsers could directly communicate with Synapse over WebSocket, simplifying integration for web-based agents. ]

---

## Proposed Solution (Optional)

If you have thoughts on how it could be implemented, share them.

[ Example: Add a new `WebSocketTransport` class implementing the transport interface. Use `websockets` or `aiohttp` for server-side support. ]
